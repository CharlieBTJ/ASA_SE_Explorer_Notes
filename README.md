üèúÔ∏è All Explorer Notes and Dossiers in Ark: Survival Ascended Scorched Earth
üó∫Ô∏è How to Add the Waypoints to Your Map
These waypoints will mark the location of all Explorer Notes and Dossiers on your in-game map. You have two options for installation:

Option 1: Run the Automated .BAT File (Recommended)
This is the fastest and easiest method.

Download the provided .bat file (e.g., Install_Waypoints.bat) and the Waypoints.ini file.

Double-click the .bat file to run it.

The script will automatically find your GameUserSettings.ini file and insert the necessary waypoint lines under the correct section.

Launch ARK: Survival Ascended and enjoy your marked map!

Option 2: Manual Installation
If you prefer to make the changes yourself, follow these steps:

Locate the "GameUserSettings.ini" file in your ARK installation directory. The default path is typically:\Steam\steamapps\common\ARK Survival Ascended\ShooterGame\Saved\Config\Windows

Open the GameUserSettings.ini file with a plain text editor (like Notepad).

Find the section header:[/Script/ShooterGame.ShooterGameUserSettings]

Copy all the lines from your separate Waypoints.ini file.

Paste these lines directly below the [/Script/ShooterGame.ShooterGameUserSettings] header.

Save and close the GameUserSettings.ini file.

Launch ARK: Survival Ascended.
